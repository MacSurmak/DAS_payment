# Note: The deployment to Kubernetes is intentionally left out of this pipeline
# for simplicity and security. Manual deployment after a successful build is a safer start.
# To automate deployment, you would add another job that uses secrets to configure
# kubectl and applies the manifests from the k8s/ directory.
